<h3>Wilson Minor's <br>"When We Build Talk"</h3>

<img src="img/Wilson%20MIner.jpeg" class="image2">

<p>“The potential for what we do” This statement by Wilson Miner during his <em>‘When We Build’</em> talk spoke to me immediately.  During his talk he states “It is a uniquely exciting time to be designing Interfaces, interactive digital tools and products.” as an aspiring UX Designer I believe he is right.</p>

<p>The world is full of tools, 'things'.. that surround us every day of our lives. Some we choose ourselves, and some others choose for us.  All these "things" have the potential to reflect and influence who we are as people, and how we live our lives. </p>

<p>They hold our memories, our stories... reminding us of people, and moments in our past; as well as symbolising our future.  It is no secret that the 'World of Technology' is rapidly advancing and subsequently so do the wants and needs of the human race.  We wait patiently on the release of these "things"... the latest iphone with its new advanced features.. hoping that when we have it in our posession it will improve our way of life.. "extend our capabilities" as it where, making us feel sum what improved as human beings.</p> 

<blockquote>
    <h4>“They become a symbol of ourselves.” </h4>
  
  <h6>-Wilson Miner</h6>
</blockquote>

<p>"Things" surround our everyday lives, from a car.. to a home.. to the things that fill that home.  We see them in our future, "e set goals to acquire these "things" and feel super human when we do.  We share them with others, we pass them on to loved ones and one day they may alos do the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4>“We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us”  </h4>
  
  <h6>-Marshall McLuhan </h6>
</blockquote>

    <p>On reflection of this I analysed the environment around me, looking at the laptop I was using.. the phone on my bedside table.. even the light from the light bulb in my room which made it possible to see clearly at 8pm in the evening. At this moment I could immediately embrace what McLuhan meant. "My world" is shaped around these tools. How magnificant the impact a single thought or idea, when had by someone determined to make it a reality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4>“A computer is the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds”</h4>
  
  <h6>-Marshall McLuhan </h6>
</blockquote>

<p>I particularly liked when he used this quote by McLuhan and when he spoke about how these tools extend our abilities and how we adapt around them.  This is undoubtedly my favourite quote from the talk.  It made me appreciate how powerful of an extension a computer really is.  It's truly incredible what can be achieved with the right tools.</p>

<p>Ask yourself 'What is my time to screen?'... in the morning?... Waiting for the bus?... Sitting at home?... I had never really given a vast amount of thought to how all the “gaps” in my life fill up with screen interaction. Then I thought about the other people in my life, family, friends and I could easily imagine past scenarios where they were sitting on there phone, tablet, watching tv.. filling the gaps where possible “interacting digitally with the world”.</p>

<p>My 79 year old grandmother spends a significant amount of time on her phone, online, watching netflix or on her smart tv as she has to spend alot of her day resting at home.  All these <em>'tools'</em> make her life easier, shaping and improving her everyday life. She is hard of hearing and for 25 years she couldn't hear calls from her son in America, this effected their relationship greatly.  However, now because of these <em>'tools'</em> she can stay in contact with her son and see videos and photos of her grandchildren as they grow up on a regular basis. These <em>'tools'</em> have changed her life for the better, designed in such a way that even at her age she feels comfortable to use. If they didn’t exist her life would be much different, as would our own. </p>

<p>Wilson Miner believes that the screen will shape the 21st century, and what <strong>WE</strong> do as designers will shape how these screens look and feel for the entire world.  Responding to our environment, the smallest changes we make can certaintly be the most transformative.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <h4>“We are a product of <em>'our world'</em> and <em>'our world'</em> is made of <em>'things'</em>, 
   but we are also its designer. We decide where to live, what to surround ourselves with, and with who and 
   what we spend our time and energy on”</h4>
  
  <h6>-Wilson miner</h6>
</blockquote>

<p>In conclusion, what we surround ourselves with will shape what we become, our environment is <em>forever</em> changing and will do so long after we are gone therefore it is up to us to <em>always</em> be prepared to learn, to "evolve" as technology does and will continue to do.  
    
<br><br>This talk was truly inspirational and has forever altered how I see the world.</p>
