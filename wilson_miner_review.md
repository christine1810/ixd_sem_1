# Wilson Miner 'When We Build'


“The potential for what we do” This statement by Wilson Miner during his *‘When We Build’* talk spoke to me immediately.  During his talk he states “It is a uniquely exciting time to be designing Interfaces, interactive digital tools and products.” as an aspiring UX Designer I believe he is right.

The world is full of tools, 'things'.. that surround us. Some we choose ourselves and some others choose for us.  All these 'things' either do or have the potential to reflect and shape who we are and how we live our lives. 

They may also hold our memories, our stories... reminding us of people and moments in our past as well as symbolising our future.  It is no secret that the Tech world is rapidly advancing and subsequently so do the wants and needs of the human race.  We wait patiently on the release of these 'things'... the latest iphone with its new, exciting features and we imagine how it will improve our lives when we have them.

They surround our everyday lives, from a car.. to a home.. to the things that fill that home.  We see them in our future.  We set goals to acquire these 'things' and feel amazing when we do.  We share them with others. We pass them on to loved ones and one day they may do the same.

On reflection of this I analysed the environment around me and I could immediately see what McLuhan meant. ‘My world’ is shaped around these tools.

I particularly liked when he used this quote by McLuhan and when he spoke about how these tools extend our abilities and how we adapt around them.  This is undoubtedly my favourite quote from the talk.  It made me appreciate how powerful of an extension a computer really is.  It's truly incredible what can be achieved with the right tools.

Ask yourself 'What is my time to screen?'... in the morning?... Waiting for the bus?... Sitting at home?... I had never really given a vast amount of thought to how all the “gaps” in my life fill up with screen interaction. Then I thought about the other people in my life, family, friends and I could easily imagine past scenarios where they were sitting on there phone, tablet, watching tv.. filling the gaps where possible “interacting digitally with the world”.

My 79 year old grandmother spends a fair amount of time on her phone, online, watching netflix or on her smart tv as she has to spend alot of her day resting at home.  All these *'tools'* make her life easier, shaping and improving her everyday life. She is hard of hearing and for 25 years she couldn't hear calls from her son in America, this effected their relationship greatly.  However, now because of these *'tools'* she can stay in contact with her son and see videos and photos of her grandchildren as they grow up on a regular basis. These *'tools'* have changed her life for the better, designed in such a way that even at her age she feels comfortable to use. If they didn’t exist her life would be much different, as would our own. 

Wilson Miner believes that the screen will shape the 21st century, and what **WE** do as designers will shape how these screens look and feel for the entire world.  Responding to our environment, the smallest changes we make can certaintly be the most transformative.

He also talks about how what we surround ourselves with will shape what we become and I believe he is right, our environment is *always* changing and therefore we must be *always* learning.  This talk was truly inspirational and has forever altered how I see the world.
